Original Readme :
Explorations of Using Python to play Grand Theft Auto

Pull requests welcome.

As time goes on, I will edit this with more useful information. 

The plan is to separate out the tutorial videos and "most up-to-date version." For now, I'm just exploring our possibilities of what we can actually do with Python and GTA V.

The files with "part" in them are from specific tutorials. 

The actual main files here are:

main.py - runs the program
directkeys.py - handles key inputs
draw_lanes.py - finds the two "most likely" lanes out of all of the lines.
